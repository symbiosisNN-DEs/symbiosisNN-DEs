Currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Minho focused on enhancing the performance of real-world systems modelling (physics, biology, chemistry, finance and engineering) by exploring the symbiosis of differential equations and neural networks and the integration of expert-knowledge, in the form of explicit constraints, into neural networks.
